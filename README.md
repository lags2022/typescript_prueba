# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Go to the bak folder and execute this line of code to start the server:

`$ json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`

If it is not installed, inside the back folder:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

2. In the parent folder:

`$ npm start`
